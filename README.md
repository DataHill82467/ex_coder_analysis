How to remain a happy coder in a coder’s career


After a few years on the job, many programmers are faced with various job offers where they take on more responsibility for staff or management positions.

However, this is not always a decision made solely because of a change in interest or a new passion. The higher salary that comes with such positions can also be a motivating factor. We want to learn more about their motivations and why they chose such a path.

We formulate four research questions:
Research Question 1: Would former programmers return to programming if it weren’t for the money?
Research Question 2: Do ex-coders have a higher motivation for learning new things?
Research Question 3: Are ex-coders who would still consider coding, happy with their current job?
Research Question 4: What are the best predictors?

Conclusion:
It looks like active programming will remain a motivation throughout your career. If you are one of those people who would like to start programming again but won’t because of the higher salary you earn today, you might stay in your current job but find hobbies related to programming or start a side project.
Don’t stay miserable! The data shows that you are probably ready to learn new technologies. So it’s always possible that you’ll learn a new programming language on the side.
